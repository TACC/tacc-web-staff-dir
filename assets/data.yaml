    biography: |-
      Dr. Ruhela joined the HPC group at TACC in January 2020.  Before TACC, he was working in the Network-Based Computing Laboratory at The Ohio State University. He has more than 17 years of  R&D experience in HPC, Social Computing, and Telecommunication.  He is currently working on novel designs and algorithms in parallel communication to deliver the best performance and scalability for scientific and engineering applications. He has also conducted large scalability studies and performance evaluations of HPC applications on leading supercomputers.

      Dr. Ruhela received his Ph.D. degree from IIT Delhi and B.Tech degree from NIT Kurukshetra, both in Computer Science. He has worked closely with researchers from The Ohio State University, NICTA Australia (now called Data61), IIT-D, and C-DOT Delhi. He has worked with computational scientists and researchers from TACC, SDSC, OSC, UMH, LLNS, University of Oregon, NCAR, and EPFL on NSF and XSEDE proposals.

      Dr. Zhang joined the High-Performance Computing group at the Texas Advanced Computing Center as Research Associate in 2021. He has been collaborating with the DesignSafe community, and many corporations on various projects. His current research interests include high-performance computing applications for natural hazards research such as earthquakes, fault displacement, landslide and liquefaction, scientific machine learning, advanced numerical simulations, and parallel computing.

      During 2019-2021, Dr. Zhang worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar within the B. John Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles. He made remarkable contributions to developing computational and physical modeling and data analytics methodologies in design and performance assessment of life pipelines and infrastructure systems, to further enhance their resilience and sustainability. In addition, he devised an advanced computational flow for regional-scale nonlinear rupture-to-structure simulation by utilizing TACC’s HPC facilities. 

      Dr. Zhang received his Ph.D. in Civil Engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2019. His Ph.D. research focused on earthquake engineering, computational mechanics, and soil-structure interaction.
