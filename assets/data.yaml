    biography: |-
      Dr. Ruhela will join High Performance Computing (HPC) group at TACC Austin in January 2020. He has 16 years of academic and industrial research and development work experience in HPC, Social Computing, and Telecommunication domains. He is currently working in the Network-Based Computing Laboratory at The Ohio State University.  He has carried out extensive performance evaluations and scalability studies at leading supercomputers.  Leveraging the latest features and mechanisms in modern interconnects and many-core processors, he has explored new designs, protocols, and algorithms in the MPI library to deliver the best performance and scalability for scientific and engineering applications.

      Dr. Ruhela received his Ph.D. degree from IIT Delhi and B.Tech degree from NIT Kurukshetra, both in Computer Science. He has worked closely with researchers from NICTA Australia (now called Data61), IIT Delhi, and C-DOT Delhi.  He has also worked with computational scientists and researchers of TACC, SDSC, OSC, UMH, LLNS, University of Oregon, NCAR, and EPFL on NSF and XSEDE proposals.
